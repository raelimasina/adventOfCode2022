# Advent of Code 2022

This year I will be solving the puzzles using E6 JavaScript. It is my first year participating in this advent and I look forward to practicing
creative problem solving and learning from other engineers.

If you would like to participate along with me, you can sign up here: https://adventofcode.com/.
